# Wikipedia-Automation-Project
This is an automation project that intends to bring data straight from the website Wikipedia into a JSON format, transform it into a normal dataframe using Python, and put the results into a PostGreSQL table.

This project was the result of a collaboration between myself and Chris Cate at AmeriHealth Caritas. I am trying to improve my data engineering and automation skills, and this was the first project he and I worked on together.
